👋 Hi there! I'm **Aymen** from Algeria 🇩🇿, a PhD student in machine learning, currently studying at both the [University of Poitiers](https://www.univ-poitiers.fr/) in France 🇫🇷 and the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/gjovik) in Norway 🇳🇴. I’m fortunate to be co-advised by [Mohamed-Chaker LARABI](https://xlim-sic.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/larabi/) and [Seyed Ali Amirshahi](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/s.ali.amirshahi), with partial funding from the Nouvelle-Aquitaine Research Council under the [REALISME]() project.

🔍 My research interests lie in the fascinating fields of machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning. I'm especially passionate about developing innovative algorithms for image processing and exploring their applications in Quality Assessment for Augmented Reality. 🖼️

💡 In addition to this, I’m also working on applying cutting-edge AI models to tackle challenges in medical imaging. 🏥 I’m deeply interested in the development of new algorithms tailored for AI startups, aiming to push the boundaries of what’s possible in this exciting space.

Let’s connect and explore the future of AI together! 🌍🚀
