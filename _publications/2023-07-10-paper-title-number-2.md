Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a widespread condition that can cause chronic pain and stiffness in the knee joint. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for successful clinical intervention and man agement to prevent severe complications, such as loss of mobility. In this paper, we propose an automated approach that employs the Swin Transformer to predict the severity of KOA. Our model uses publicly available radiographic datasets with Kellgren and Lawrence scores to enable early detection and severity assessment. Toimprovetheaccuracyofourmodel,weemployamulti-prediction head architecture that utilizes multi-layer perceptron classifiers. Additionally, we introduce a novel training approach that reduces the data drift between multiple datasets to ensure the generalization ability of the model. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach in predicting KOA severity accurately.
